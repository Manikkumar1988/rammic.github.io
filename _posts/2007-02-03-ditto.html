As a frequent listener of <a href="http://stodid.libsyn.com/">STODID</a>, I have to say that I'm in complete agreement with <a href="http://connectid.blogspot.com/2007/01/tsooiaoboos-story-of-openid-and.html">Paul</a>. Not that I'm not interested in OpenID, but let's diversify a bit...<br /><br />I'm glad <a href="http://stodid.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=177333">Aldo is listening</a>, however. Maybe some specific discussions about these technologies in the enterprise realm (and no, not just OpenID).<br /><br />:)
