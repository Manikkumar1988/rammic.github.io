The latest version of the InfoCard integration guide calls out a problem that I <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1179519&SiteID=1">groaned about earlier</a>:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">IMPORTANT NOTE: Notice that the URI used as the value of the ValueType attribute on </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">the wsse:KeyIdentifier element to indicate a SHA1 thumbprint based key identifier is a </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">slightly outdated URI value. The new prescribed value as per the WS-Security v1.1 standard </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">should be as follows: </span><br /><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;"><br />http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/oasis-wss-soap-message-security-1.1#ThumbPrintSHA1<br /><br /></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-style: italic;">Support for this newer URI will be added in a future versions of the Information Card Profile.  </span></span><br /><br />So as much as I would like to think that someone out there actually listened to my complaints, I realized that this was probably documented before I said anything. Oh well.
