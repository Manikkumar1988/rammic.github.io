<a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/02/17/216216">Slashdot</a> points to an article describing the "cracking" of facial recognition software used as an alternative login for some laptops. It may be a liberal use of the term "cracking," but it's yet another reason why biometrics should be used sparingly (if at all) and as a single factor in a multi-factor authentication system. It's just too easy to capture and reproduce human qualities that most biometric readers will believe. Try revoking those credentials.<br /><br />Someone in the identity movement should contact Hollywood and tell them to knock off the sci-fi authentication schemes. I'm convinced that is where much of this biometric craze originates. Isn't painful to watch a show where biometrics provide the "strong" security (which actually offer trivial protection), and the next scene has a ciphertext or firewall being cracked in seconds?
