Count me in as "disappointed." I was really looking forward to using my iPhone to access my Slingbox when the mobile application came out (and had even convinced myself that the $30 would be worth it), but that's not a concern anymore since Sling has decided that they're arbitrarily removing <a href="http://www.slingcommunity.com/blog/entry/34653/Update-SlingPlayer-Mobile-for-iPhone-Only-for-Slingbox-PRO-SOLO-and-PRO-HD-Users/">support for non-pro devices.</a> I miss the days when companies encouraged upgrading by adding features, not by <a href="http://www.engadgethd.com/2009/04/02/older-slingboxes-wont-work-with-slingplayer-for-iphone/">simply deprecating their previous product line</a>.<div><br /></div><div>Dumb move on their part, but it's at least one less thing to waste money on.</div>
