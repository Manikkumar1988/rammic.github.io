I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one out there battling various Cardspace <a href="http://eternaloptimist.wordpress.com/2007/06/14/fun-with-xhtml-selector-triggers/trackback/">bugs and quirks</a>. I'm shocked that I hadn't see her blog earlier.<br /><br />As the shepherd of the Pamelaware module, maybe she can focus a bit of effort in quashing the <a href="http://rammic.blogspot.com/2007/06/interop-opensaml-and-php-infocard.html">bugs in that code</a> which were inherited from Kim's implementation.
