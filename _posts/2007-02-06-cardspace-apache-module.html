Ashish Jain <a href="http://itickr.com/index.php/?p=56">announced</a> the release of the Apache CardSpace Module today in his blog. I'm really happy to hear that. Together with the Firefox 3.0 adoption of the spec, there should be plenty of tools to start piecing together some really interesting solutions.<br /><br />But where is the bigger fish (IMO), <a href="http://itickr.com/index.php/?p=38">the open-source STS</a>? There is apparently some interest judging from the comments on his blog, but emails requesting access have thus far been dismissed. Or maybe it's just my emails.
