Just a quick note about something I discovered- After upgrading my Windows XP virtual machine to Windows 7 x64 Professional, I was no longer able to access sites which required a DoD Common Access Card (CAC). Tinkering with Wireshark and Google Chrome finally appeared to reveal an answer: Windows 7 x64 (and possibly other versions, I don't know for sure) doesn't want to present a client certificate over anything but SSLv3.0. <div><br /></div><div>So if you're having problems, be sure to go to Internet Options -> Advanced -> Security (Bottom of the list) and uncheck everything but SSLv3 as supported. That should reenable CAC authentication to DoD PKI websites.</div>
