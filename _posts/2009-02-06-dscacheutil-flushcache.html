I've been needing to flush the DNS cache on my Mac a lot lately. (Possibly due to VPN hackery) Anyway, the nice little utility for OSX to flush the DNS cache (dscacheutil) is okay, but I'm pretty sure that it also flushes out any Safari cookies/sessions too. Isn't there a less destructive command for clearing the DNS cache?
